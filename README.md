# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I created this webpage to be an easily accessible and concide collection of notes for the prework section of my bootcamp. Notes tend to lose themselved or be misplaced, so this is a permanent location to keep track of the notes I kept during prework. This also serves as baseline project to come back to see how far I have gone.

## Usage

This guide can be used to look over notes concerning HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. You can access the DevTools console to see the JavaScript code running. This code alse lists the topics covered and can choose what you should study next.
